# arachnid

A repo for the Arachnid Robotics Robot Spider control system.

## Assumptions

This exercise makes the following assumptions:

-   The robot starts in the bottom left corner, and initially points in the x direction. Therefore, moving forward increases the x coordinate by one.
-   A command to tell the robot to move rotates the robot in that direction _before_ moving it.
